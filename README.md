# Hypotenuse Calculator

This Python program, `calculate_hypotenuse`, takes the lengths of two sides of a right triangle as input and calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. 
The program uses the formula:

H^2 = B^2 + P^2
(Hypotenuse**2 = Base**2 + Perpendicular**2)

Where H is the length of the hypotenuse, and B and P are the lengths of the other two sides.

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter the lengths of the perpendicular and base sides of a right triangle.

2. The program will calculate the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. The program will output the calculated length of the hypotenuse.
